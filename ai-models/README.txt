This folder contains state-machine-graphs of various AI modules implemented.

All files are textual representations that "graphviz" utilites use to generate visuals. The documentation file ( if there is one) also contains visual graphs of AI modules, although they might not be up to date.

The "splitter" file is a "gvpr" program, and I use it to extract images from a file that contains multiple graphs.
